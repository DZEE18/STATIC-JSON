            "description": "The sink and tap fittings are essential elements in a kitchen, not only from a merely practical and functional perspective, but also because they can contribute to the aesthetic outcome of a furnishing project, due to the variety of forms and materials available. Materials and finishes are to be chosen in harmony with the kitchen style. A sink in ceramic or stone fits better with a classic or rustic style, while steel or composite materials are the perfect solution in kitchens with a more contemporary mood."
